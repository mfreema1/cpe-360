//Our three main data structures are the stack, queue, and linked list
//These are much the same with each other, they each hold pointers from one element
//to the other.

//The main way in which they differ is in the way they add or delete elements.
//STACK: LIFO or last in first out
//QUEUE: FIFO or first in first out
//LINKED LIST: No real philosophy on adding or removing elements
